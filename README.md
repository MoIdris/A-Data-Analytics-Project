### Introducton
The success of a start-up is heavily reliant on ideas, innovation, and execution. However, these alone may not be sufficient. It the financial backing or “funding” from investors that enables or allows start-ups and other entrepreneurial projects with great aspirations to dream big, achieve wealth, and make a significant impacts. In this project, I will be investigating the funding that start-ups in India received from investors from the year 2018 to 2021. The dataset provided includes separate csv files for each year’s funding data. These files contain details about the start-ups, the funding they received, and the investors informations.
